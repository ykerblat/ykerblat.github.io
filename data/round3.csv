1,Jābir ibn Hayyān,768,1736,968,compounded ether,Credited with discovery of sulphuric acid & hydrochloric acid and possibly with the creation of aqua regia which dissolves gold.,In the seventeenth century the German-Dutch chemist Johann Glauber prepared sulfuric acid by burning sulfur together with saltpeter (potassium nitrate KNO3) in the presence of steam. As saltpeter decomposes it oxidizes the sulfur to SO3 which combines with water to produce sulfuric acid. In 1736 Joshua Ward a London pharmacist used this method to begin the first large-scale production of sulfuric acid.,chemistry,TOP," 206,000 "

Pope Sylvester II tried to spread knowledge of numerals in Europe from the 980s & Fibonacci promoted numerals in his Liber Abaci published 1202.,mathematics,LOW," 604,000 "
5,al-Khwārizmi,815,1202,387,Hindu numerals,Placed zero at the centre of mathematics by working out what it means and how it can be used (the concept of zero was developed earlier principally by Brahmagupta but his basics were incorrect).,Fibonacci introduced zero to the west in his Liber Abaci.

The Jim Al Khalili book doesn't specify exactly what Dante used from al-Farghani's work but confirms the link between Dante and al-Farghani's calcs. ,Dante used al-Farghani's writings to inform his Divine Comedy.
